## NOTE:
This fork of ExpansionHunter contains I/O optimizations that speed up the tool by 2-3x without changing the output. 
These optimizations bring down the cost of running ExpansionHunter on very large variants catalogs and/or large numbers of samples. 
These changes are hosted here pending review and incorporation into the main ExpansionHunter repo. 

Compiled binaries for MacOSX and Linux are available in the [`bin`](https://github.com/bw2/ExpansionHunter/tree/master/bin) directory.

# Expansion Hunter: a tool for estimating repeat sizes

There are a number of regions in the human genome consisting of repetitions of
short unit sequence (commonly a trimer). Such repeat regions can expand to a
size much larger than the read length and thereby cause a disease.
[Fragile X Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome),
[ALS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis), and
[Huntington's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease)
are well known examples.

Expansion Hunter aims to estimate sizes of such repeats by performing a targeted
search through a BAM/CRAM file for reads that span, flank, and are fully
contained in each repeat.

Linux and macOS operating systems are currently supported.
